    <h1>Basic Food Safety</h1>
    <p>Food safety involves handling, preparing, and storing food in ways that prevent foodborne illness and contamination. It encompasses various practices that ensure food is safe to consume, protecting public health. Understanding and implementing basic food safety principles can significantly reduce the risk of foodborne diseases.</p><br>
    <h2>Introduction to Food Safety</h2>
    <p>Food safety is crucial for preventing foodborne illnesses, which can result from consuming contaminated food. Contaminants include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemical substances. Ensuring food safety involves the entire food production chain, from farm to table. Key principles include:<br>
        =><b>Cleaning:</b> Regularly washing hands, surfaces, and utensils.<br>
        =><b>Separating:</b> Avoiding cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods.<br>
        =><b>Cooking:</b> Properly cooking food to kill harmful organisms.<br>
        =><b>Chilling:</b> Storing food at correct temperatures to slow bacterial growth.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Personal Hygiene for Food Handlers</h2>
    <p>Personal hygiene is a critical aspect of food safety, as food handlers can easily transfer pathogens to food. Important practices include:<br>
        =><b>Handwashing:</b> Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling food, after using the restroom, and after handling raw meat, poultry, or seafood.<br>
        =><b>Personal Cleanliness:</b> Keep fingernails short and clean, avoid wearing jewelry, and cover cuts or sores with waterproof bandages.<br>
        =><b>Proper Attire:</b> Wear clean clothing and hair restraints (hats or hairnets). Avoid wearing strong perfumes or colognes.<br>
        =><b>Illness:</b> Food handlers who are sick, especially with symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, should not handle food.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Safe Food Handling Practices</h2>
    <p>Safe food handling is essential to prevent contamination and ensure food safety. Key practices include:<br>
        =><b>Cleaning:</b> Regularly clean and sanitize all food contact surfaces and utensils.<br>
        =><b>Separating:</b> Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat and ready-to-eat foods.<br>
        =><b>Cooking:</b> Cook food to the right temperature to kill harmful microorganisms. Use a food thermometer to check.<br>
        =><b>Chilling:</b> Refrigerate perishable foods promptly. Never leave food out of refrigeration for more than two hours (one hour if above 90°F/32°C).
    </p><br>
    <h2>Cross-Contamination Prevention</h2>
    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when harmful bacteria or allergens are transferred from one food or surface to another. Preventing cross-contamination involves:<br>
        =><b>Using Separate Equipment:</b> Use different cutting boards, knives, and utensils for raw and cooked foods.<br>
        =><b>Proper Storage:</b> Store raw meat, poultry, and seafood below ready-to-eat foods in the refrigerator to prevent juices from dripping onto other foods.<br>
        =><b>Cleaning Surfaces:</b> Clean and sanitize work surfaces, equipment, and utensils after each use.<br>
        =><b>Handling Food:</b> Avoid touching food with bare hands; use gloves or utensils.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Temperature Control and Food Storage</h2>
    <p>Proper temperature control is vital for preventing the growth of harmful bacteria. Guidelines for temperature control and food storage include:<br>
        =><b>Refrigeration:</b> Keep refrigerators at or below 40°F (4°C). Store perishable foods such as meat, dairy, and leftovers promptly.<br>
        =><b>Freezing:</b> Keep freezers at or below 0°F (-18°C). Properly package food to prevent freezer burn.<br>
        =><b>Cooking Temperatures:</b> Cook foods to the appropriate internal temperature (e.g., 165°F/74°C for poultry, 145°F/63°C for most seafood and whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and veal).<br>
        =><b>Hot Holding:</b> Keep hot foods at 140°F (60°C) or above.<br>
        =><b>Cooling:</b> Cool cooked foods quickly. Use shallow containers to store leftovers and refrigerate within two hours.<br>
        =><b>Thawing:</b> Thaw food in the refrigerator, under cold running water, or in the microwave, but never on the counter.<br>
